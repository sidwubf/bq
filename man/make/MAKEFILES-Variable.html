This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.82.

<h3 class="section">3.4 The Variable <code>MAKEFILES</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-makefile_002c-and-_0040code_007bMAKEFILES_007d-variable-88"></a><a name="index-including-_0028_0040code_007bMAKEFILES_007d-variable_0029-89"></a>
<a name="index-MAKEFILES-90"></a>If the environment variable <code>MAKEFILES</code> is defined, <code>make</code>
considers its value as a list of names (separated by whitespace) of
additional makefiles to be read before the others.  This works much
like the <code>include</code> directive: various directories are searched
for those files (see <a href="Include.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>).  In
addition, the default goal is never taken from one of these makefiles
(or any makefile included by them) and it is not an error if the files
listed in <code>MAKEFILES</code> are not found.

   <p><a name="index-recursion_002c-and-_0040code_007bMAKEFILES_007d-variable-91"></a>The main use of <code>MAKEFILES</code> is in communication between recursive
invocations of <code>make</code> (see <a href="Recursion.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>).  It usually is not desirable to set the environment
variable before a top-level invocation of <code>make</code>, because it is
usually better not to mess with a makefile from outside.  However, if
you are running <code>make</code> without a specific makefile, a makefile in
<code>MAKEFILES</code> can do useful things to help the built-in implicit
rules work better, such as defining search paths (see <a href="Directory-Search.html#Directory-Search">Directory Search</a>).

   <p>Some users are tempted to set <code>MAKEFILES</code> in the environment
automatically on login, and program makefiles to expect this to be done. 
This is a very bad idea, because such makefiles will fail to work if run by
anyone else.  It is much better to write explicit <code>include</code> directives
in the makefiles.  See <a href="Include.html#Include">Including Other Makefiles</a>.
