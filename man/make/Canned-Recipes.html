<h3 class="section">5.8 Defining Canned Recipes</h3>

<p><a name="index-canned-recipes-449"></a><a name="index-recipes_002c-canned-450"></a><a name="index-sequences-of-commands-451"></a><a name="index-commands_002c-sequences-of-452"></a>
When the same sequence of commands is useful in making various
targets, you can define it as a canned sequence with the <code>define</code>
directive, and refer to the canned sequence from the recipes for those
targets.  The canned sequence is actually a variable, so the name must
not conflict with other variable names.

   <p>Here is an example of defining a canned recipe:

<pre class="example">     define run-yacc =
     yacc $(firstword $^)
     mv y.tab.c $@
     endef
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007byacc_007d-453"></a>
Here <code>run-yacc</code> is the name of the variable being defined;
<code>endef</code> marks the end of the definition; the lines in between are the
commands.  The <code>define</code> directive does not expand variable references
and function calls in the canned sequence; the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; characters,
parentheses, variable names, and so on, all become part of the value of the
variable you are defining. 
See <a href="Multi_002dLine.html#Multi_002dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>,
for a complete explanation of <code>define</code>.

   <p>The first command in this example runs Yacc on the first prerequisite of
whichever rule uses the canned sequence.  The output file from Yacc is
always named <samp><span class="file">y.tab.c</span></samp>.  The second command moves the output to the
rule's target file name.

   <p>To use the canned sequence, substitute the variable into the recipe of a
rule.  You can substitute it like any other variable
(see <a href="Reference.html#Reference">Basics of Variable References</a>). 
Because variables defined by <code>define</code> are recursively expanded
variables, all the variable references you wrote inside the <code>define</code>
are expanded now.  For example:

<pre class="example">     foo.c : foo.y
             $(run-yacc)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.y</span></samp>&rsquo; will be substituted for the variable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$^</span></samp>&rsquo; when it occurs in
<code>run-yacc</code>'s value, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.c</span></samp>&rsquo; for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>This is a realistic example, but this particular one is not needed in
practice because <code>make</code> has an implicit rule to figure out these
commands based on the file names involved
(see <a href="Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>).

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040_0040_002c-and-_0040code_007bdefine_007d-454"></a><a name="index-g_t_002d_002c-and-_0040code_007bdefine_007d-455"></a><a name="index-g_t_002b_002c-and-_0040code_007bdefine_007d-456"></a>In recipe execution, each line of a canned sequence is treated just as
if the line appeared on its own in the rule, preceded by a tab.  In
particular, <code>make</code> invokes a separate subshell for each line.  You
can use the special prefix characters that affect command lines
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo;) on each line of a canned sequence. 
See <a href="Recipes.html#Recipes">Writing Recipes in Rules</a>. 
For example, using this canned sequence:

<pre class="example">     define frobnicate =
     @echo "frobnicating target $@"
     frob-step-1 $&lt; -o $@-step-1
     frob-step-2 $@-step-1 -o $@
     endef
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><code>make</code> will not echo the first line, the <code>echo</code> command. 
But it <em>will</em> echo the following two recipe lines.

   <p>On the other hand, prefix characters on the recipe line that refers to
a canned sequence apply to every line in the sequence.  So the rule:

<pre class="example">     frob.out: frob.in
             @$(frobnicate)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">does not echo <em>any</em> recipe lines. 
(See <a href="Echoing.html#Echoing">Recipe Echoing</a>, for a full explanation of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;.)
