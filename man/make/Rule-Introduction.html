This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h3 class="section">2.1 What a Rule Looks Like</h3>

<p><a name="index-rule_002c-introduction-to-10"></a><a name="index-makefile-rule-parts-11"></a><a name="index-parts-of-makefile-rule-12"></a>
A simple makefile consists of &ldquo;rules&rdquo; with the following shape:

   <p><a name="index-targets_002c-introduction-to-13"></a><a name="index-prerequisites_002c-introduction-to-14"></a><a name="index-recipes_002c-introduction-to-15"></a>
<pre class="example">     <var>target</var> ... : <var>prerequisites</var> ...
             <var>recipe</var>
             ...
             ...
</pre>
   <p>A <dfn>target</dfn> is usually the name of a file that is generated by a
program; examples of targets are executable or object files.  A target
can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">clean</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="Phony-Targets.html#Phony-Targets">Phony Targets</a>).

   <p>A <dfn>prerequisite</dfn> is a file that is used as input to create the
target.  A target often depends on several files.

   <p><a name="index-tabs-in-rules-16"></a>A <dfn>recipe</dfn> is an action that <code>make</code> carries out.  A recipe
may have more than one command, either on the same line or each on its
own line.  <strong>Please note:</strong> you need to put a tab character at
the beginning of every recipe line!  This is an obscurity that catches
the unwary.  If you prefer to prefix your recipes with a character
other than tab, you can set the <code>.RECIPEPREFIX</code> variable to an
alternate character (see <a href="Special-Variables.html#Special-Variables">Special Variables</a>).

   <p>Usually a recipe is in a rule with prerequisites and serves to create a
target file if any of the prerequisites change.  However, the rule that
specifies a recipe for the target need not have prerequisites.  For
example, the rule containing the delete command associated with the
target &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">clean</span></samp>&rsquo; does not have prerequisites.

   <p>A <dfn>rule</dfn>, then, explains how and when to remake certain files
which are the targets of the particular rule.  <code>make</code> carries out
the recipe on the prerequisites to create or update the target.  A
rule can also explain how and when to carry out an action. 
See <a href="Rules.html#Rules">Writing Rules</a>.

   <p>A makefile may contain other text besides rules, but a simple makefile
need only contain rules.  Rules may look somewhat more complicated
than shown in this template, but all fit the pattern more or less.
