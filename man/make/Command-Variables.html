This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h3 class="section">14.3 Variables for Specifying Commands</h3>

<p>Makefiles should provide variables for overriding certain commands, options,
and so on.

   <p>In particular, you should run most utility programs via variables. 
Thus, if you use Bison, have a variable named <code>BISON</code> whose default
value is set with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BISON = bison</span></samp>&rsquo;, and refer to it with
<code>$(BISON)</code> whenever you need to use Bison.

   <p>File management utilities such as <code>ln</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>mv</code>, and
so on, need not be referred to through variables in this way, since users
don't need to replace them with other programs.

   <p>Each program-name variable should come with an options variable that is
used to supply options to the program.  Append &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">FLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
program-name variable name to get the options variable name&mdash;for
example, <code>BISONFLAGS</code>.  (The names <code>CFLAGS</code> for the C
compiler, <code>YFLAGS</code> for yacc, and <code>LFLAGS</code> for lex, are
exceptions to this rule, but we keep them because they are standard.) 
Use <code>CPPFLAGS</code> in any compilation command that runs the
preprocessor, and use <code>LDFLAGS</code> in any compilation command that
does linking as well as in any direct use of <code>ld</code>.

   <p>If there are C compiler options that <em>must</em> be used for proper
compilation of certain files, do not include them in <code>CFLAGS</code>. 
Users expect to be able to specify <code>CFLAGS</code> freely themselves. 
Instead, arrange to pass the necessary options to the C compiler
independently of <code>CFLAGS</code>, by writing them explicitly in the
compilation commands or by defining an implicit rule, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     CFLAGS = -g
     ALL_CFLAGS = -I. $(CFLAGS)
     .c.o:
             $(CC) -c $(CPPFLAGS) $(ALL_CFLAGS) $&lt;
</pre>
   <p>Do include the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g</span></samp>&rsquo; option in <code>CFLAGS</code>, because that is not
<em>required</em> for proper compilation.  You can consider it a default
that is only recommended.  If the package is set up so that it is
compiled with GCC by default, then you might as well include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O</span></samp>&rsquo;
in the default value of <code>CFLAGS</code> as well.

   <p>Put <code>CFLAGS</code> last in the compilation command, after other variables
containing compiler options, so the user can use <code>CFLAGS</code> to
override the others.

   <p><code>CFLAGS</code> should be used in every invocation of the C compiler,
both those which do compilation and those which do linking.

   <p>Every Makefile should define the variable <code>INSTALL</code>, which is the
basic command for installing a file into the system.

   <p>Every Makefile should also define the variables <code>INSTALL_PROGRAM</code>
and <code>INSTALL_DATA</code>.  (The default for <code>INSTALL_PROGRAM</code> should
be <code>$(INSTALL)</code>; the default for <code>INSTALL_DATA</code> should be
<code>${INSTALL} -m 644</code>.)  Then it should use those variables as the
commands for actual installation, for executables and non-executables
respectively.  Minimal use of these variables is as follows:

<pre class="example">     $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo $(bindir)/foo
     $(INSTALL_DATA) libfoo.a $(libdir)/libfoo.a
</pre>
   <p>However, it is preferable to support a <code>DESTDIR</code> prefix on the
target files, as explained in the next section.

   <p>It is acceptable, but not required, to install multiple files in one
command, with the final argument being a directory, as in:

<pre class="example">     $(INSTALL_PROGRAM) foo bar baz $(bindir)
</pre>
   </body></html>
