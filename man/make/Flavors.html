<h3 class="section">6.2 The Two Flavors of Variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-flavors-of-variables-469"></a><a name="index-recursive-variable-expansion-470"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-flavors-471"></a><a name="index-recursively-expanded-variables-472"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-recursively-expanded-473"></a>
There are two ways that a variable in GNU <code>make</code> can have a value;
we call them the two <dfn>flavors</dfn> of variables.  The two flavors are
distinguished in how they are defined and in what they do when expanded.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_003d-474"></a>The first flavor of variable is a <dfn>recursively expanded</dfn> variable. 
Variables of this sort are defined by lines using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="Setting.html#Setting">Setting Variables</a>) or by the <code>define</code> directive
(see <a href="Multi_002dLine.html#Multi_002dLine">Defining Multi-Line Variables</a>).  The value you specify
is installed verbatim; if it contains references to other variables,
these references are expanded whenever this variable is substituted (in
the course of expanding some other string).  When this happens, it is
called <dfn>recursive expansion</dfn>.

   <p>For example,

<pre class="example">     foo = $(bar)
     bar = $(ugh)
     ugh = Huh?
     
     all:;echo $(foo)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will echo &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Huh?</span></samp>&rsquo;: &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(foo)</span></samp>&rsquo; expands to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(bar)</span></samp>&rsquo; which
expands to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(ugh)</span></samp>&rsquo; which finally expands to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Huh?</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>This flavor of variable is the only sort supported by other versions of
<code>make</code>.  It has its advantages and its disadvantages.  An advantage
(most would say) is that:

<pre class="example">     CFLAGS = $(include_dirs) -O
     include_dirs = -Ifoo -Ibar
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will do what was intended: when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">CFLAGS</span></samp>&rsquo; is expanded in a recipe,
it will expand to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Ifoo -Ibar -O</span></samp>&rsquo;.  A major disadvantage is that you
cannot append something on the end of a variable, as in

<pre class="example">     CFLAGS = $(CFLAGS) -O
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">because it will cause an infinite loop in the variable expansion. 
(Actually <code>make</code> detects the infinite loop and reports an error.) 
<a name="index-loops-in-variable-expansion-475"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-loops-in-expansion-476"></a>
Another disadvantage is that any functions
(see <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions for Transforming Text</a>)
referenced in the definition will be executed every time the variable is
expanded.  This makes <code>make</code> run slower; worse, it causes the
<code>wildcard</code> and <code>shell</code> functions to give unpredictable results
because you cannot easily control when they are called, or even how many
times.

   <p>To avoid all the problems and inconveniences of recursively expanded
variables, there is another flavor: simply expanded variables.

   <p><a name="index-simply-expanded-variables-477"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-simply-expanded-478"></a><a name="index-g_t_003a_003d-479"></a><dfn>Simply expanded variables</dfn> are defined by lines using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo;
(see <a href="Setting.html#Setting">Setting Variables</a>). 
The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned
once and for all, expanding any references to other variables and
functions, when the variable is defined.  The actual value of the simply
expanded variable is the result of expanding the text that you write. 
It does not contain any references to other variables; it contains their
values <em>as of the time this variable was defined</em>.  Therefore,

<pre class="example">     x := foo
     y := $(x) bar
     x := later
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is equivalent to

<pre class="example">     y := foo bar
     x := later
</pre>
   <p>When a simply expanded variable is referenced, its value is substituted
verbatim.

   <p>Here is a somewhat more complicated example, illustrating the use of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; in conjunction with the <code>shell</code> function. 
(See <a href="Shell-Function.html#Shell-Function">The <code>shell</code> Function</a>.)  This example
also shows use of the variable <code>MAKELEVEL</code>, which is changed
when it is passed down from level to level. 
(See <a href="Variables_002fRecursion.html#Variables_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>, for information about <code>MAKELEVEL</code>.)

   <p><a name="index-MAKELEVEL-480"></a><a name="index-MAKE-481"></a>
<pre class="example">     ifeq (0,${MAKELEVEL})
     whoami    := $(shell whoami)
     host-type := $(shell arch)
     MAKE := ${MAKE} host-type=${host-type} whoami=${whoami}
     endif
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">An advantage of this use of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:=</span></samp>&rsquo; is that a typical
`descend into a directory' recipe then looks like this:

<pre class="example">     ${subdirs}:
             ${MAKE} -C $@ all
</pre>
   <p>Simply expanded variables generally make complicated makefile programming
more predictable because they work like variables in most programming
languages.  They allow you to redefine a variable using its own value (or
its value processed in some way by one of the expansion functions) and to
use the expansion functions much more efficiently
(see <a href="Functions.html#Functions">Functions for Transforming Text</a>).

   <p><a name="index-spaces_002c-in-variable-values-482"></a><a name="index-whitespace_002c-in-variable-values-483"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-spaces-in-values-484"></a>You can also use them to introduce controlled leading whitespace into
variable values.  Leading whitespace characters are discarded from your
input before substitution of variable references and function calls;
this means you can include leading spaces in a variable value by
protecting them with variable references, like this:

<pre class="example">     nullstring :=
     space := $(nullstring) # end of the line
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the value of the variable <code>space</code> is precisely one space.  The
comment &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#&nbsp;end&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;line</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> is included here just for clarity. 
Since trailing space characters are <em>not</em> stripped from variable
values, just a space at the end of the line would have the same effect
(but be rather hard to read).  If you put whitespace at the end of a
variable value, it is a good idea to put a comment like that at the end
of the line to make your intent clear.  Conversely, if you do <em>not</em>
want any whitespace characters at the end of your variable value, you
must remember not to put a random comment on the end of the line after
some whitespace, such as this:

<pre class="example">     dir := /foo/bar    # directory to put the frobs in
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Here the value of the variable <code>dir</code> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">/foo/bar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->
(with four trailing spaces), which was probably not the intention. 
(Imagine something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(dir)/file</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> with this definition!)

   <p><a name="index-conditional-variable-assignment-485"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-conditional-assignment-486"></a><a name="index-g_t_003f_003d-487"></a>There is another assignment operator for variables, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?=</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This
is called a conditional variable assignment operator, because it only
has an effect if the variable is not yet defined.  This statement:

<pre class="example">     FOO ?= bar
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is exactly equivalent to this
(see <a href="Origin-Function.html#Origin-Function">The <code>origin</code> Function</a>):

<pre class="example">     ifeq ($(origin FOO), undefined)
       FOO = bar
     endif
</pre>
   <p>Note that a variable set to an empty value is still defined, so
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?=</span></samp>&rsquo; will not set that variable.
