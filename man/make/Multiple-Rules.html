This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.82.

<h3 class="section">4.11 Multiple Rules for One Target</h3>

<p><a name="index-multiple-rules-for-one-target-249"></a><a name="index-several-rules-for-one-target-250"></a><a name="index-rule_002c-multiple-for-one-target-251"></a><a name="index-target_002c-multiple-rules-for-one-252"></a>
One file can be the target of several rules.  All the prerequisites
mentioned in all the rules are merged into one list of prerequisites for
the target.  If the target is older than any prerequisite from any rule,
the recipe is executed.

   <p>There can only be one recipe to be executed for a file.  If more than
one rule gives a recipe for the same file, <code>make</code> uses the last
one given and prints an error message.  (As a special case, if the
file's name begins with a dot, no error message is printed.  This odd
behavior is only for compatibility with other implementations of
<code>make</code><small class="dots">...</small> you should avoid using it).  Occasionally it is
useful to have the same target invoke multiple recipes which are
defined in different parts of your makefile; you can use
<dfn>double-colon rules</dfn> (see <a href="Double_002dColon.html#Double_002dColon">Double-Colon</a>) for this.

   <p>An extra rule with just prerequisites can be used to give a few extra
prerequisites to many files at once.  For example, makefiles often
have a variable, such as <code>objects</code>, containing a list of all the
compiler output files in the system being made.  An easy way to say
that all of them must be recompiled if <samp><span class="file">config.h</span></samp> changes is to
write the following:

<pre class="example">     objects = foo.o bar.o
     foo.o : defs.h
     bar.o : defs.h test.h
     $(objects) : config.h
</pre>
   <p>This could be inserted or taken out without changing the rules that really
specify how to make the object files, making it a convenient form to use if
you wish to add the additional prerequisite intermittently.

   <p>Another wrinkle is that the additional prerequisites could be
specified with a variable that you set with a command line argument to
<code>make</code> (see <a href="Overriding.html#Overriding">Overriding Variables</a>).  For example,

<pre class="example">     extradeps=
     $(objects) : $(extradeps)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">means that the command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make extradeps=foo.h</span></samp>&rsquo; will consider
<samp><span class="file">foo.h</span></samp> as a prerequisite of each object file, but plain &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;
will not.

   <p>If none of the explicit rules for a target has a recipe, then <code>make</code>
searches for an applicable implicit rule to find one
see <a href="Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules">Using Implicit Rules</a>).
