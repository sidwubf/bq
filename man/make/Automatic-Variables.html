<h4 class="subsection">10.5.3 Automatic Variables</h4>

<p><a name="index-automatic-variables-933"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-automatic-934"></a><a name="index-variables_002c-and-implicit-rule-935"></a>
Suppose you are writing a pattern rule to compile a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; file into a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; file: how do you write the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cc</span></samp>&rsquo; command so that it operates
on the right source file name?  You cannot write the name in the recipe,
because the name is different each time the implicit rule is applied.

   <p>What you do is use a special feature of <code>make</code>, the <dfn>automatic
variables</dfn>.  These variables have values computed afresh for each rule that
is executed, based on the target and prerequisites of the rule.  In this
example, you would use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo; for the object file name and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
for the source file name.

   <p><a name="index-automatic-variables-in-prerequisites-936"></a><a name="index-prerequisites_002c-and-automatic-variables-937"></a>It's very important that you recognize the limited scope in which
automatic variable values are available: they only have values within
the recipe.  In particular, you cannot use them anywhere
within the target list of a rule; they have no value there and will
expand to the empty string.  Also, they cannot be accessed directly
within the prerequisite list of a rule.  A common mistake is
attempting to use <code>$@</code> within the prerequisites list; this will
not work.  However, there is a special feature of GNU <code>make</code>,
secondary expansion (see <a href="Secondary-Expansion.html#Secondary-Expansion">Secondary Expansion</a>), which will allow
automatic variable values to be used in prerequisite lists.

   <p>Here is a table of automatic variables:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0024_0040_0040-938"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040_0040-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-939"></a>
<dl><dt><code>$@</code><dd>The file name of the target of the rule.  If the target is an archive
member, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo; is the name of the archive file.  In a pattern
rule that has multiple targets (see <a href="Pattern-Intro.html#Pattern-Intro">Introduction to Pattern Rules</a>), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo; is the name of whichever target caused the
rule's recipe to be run.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_0025-940"></a><a name="index-g_t_0025-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-941"></a><br><dt><code>$%</code><dd>The target member name, when the target is an archive member. 
See <a href="Archives.html#Archives">Archives</a>.  For example, if the target is <samp><span class="file">foo.a(bar.o)</span></samp> then
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$%</span></samp>&rsquo; is <samp><span class="file">bar.o</span></samp> and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo; is <samp><span class="file">foo.a</span></samp>.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$%</span></samp>&rsquo; is
empty when the target is not an archive member.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_003c-942"></a><a name="index-g_t_003c-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-943"></a><br><dt><code>$&lt;</code><dd>The name of the first prerequisite.  If the target got its recipe from
an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added by the
implicit rule (see <a href="Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules">Implicit Rules</a>).

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_003f-944"></a><a name="index-g_t_003f-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-945"></a><br><dt><code>$?</code><dd>The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the target, with
spaces between them.  For prerequisites which are archive members, only
the named member is used (see <a href="Archives.html#Archives">Archives</a>). 
<a name="index-prerequisites_002c-list-of-changed-946"></a><a name="index-list-of-changed-prerequisites-947"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0024_005e-948"></a><a name="index-g_t_005e-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-949"></a><br><dt><code>$^</code><dd>The names of all the prerequisites, with spaces between them.  For
prerequisites which are archive members, only the named member is used
(see <a href="Archives.html#Archives">Archives</a>).  A target has only one prerequisite on each other file
it depends on, no matter how many times each file is listed as a
prerequisite.  So if you list a prerequisite more than once for a target,
the value of <code>$^</code> contains just one copy of the name.  This list
does <strong>not</strong> contain any of the order-only prerequisites; for those
see the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$|</span></samp>&rsquo; variable, below. 
<a name="index-prerequisites_002c-list-of-all-950"></a><a name="index-list-of-all-prerequisites-951"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0024_002b-952"></a><a name="index-g_t_002b-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-953"></a><br><dt><code>$+</code><dd>This is like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$^</span></samp>&rsquo;, but prerequisites listed more than once are
duplicated in the order they were listed in the makefile.  This is
primarily useful for use in linking commands where it is meaningful to
repeat library file names in a particular order.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_007c-954"></a><a name="index-g_t_007c-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-955"></a><br><dt><code>$|</code><dd>The names of all the order-only prerequisites, with spaces between
them.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_002a-956"></a><a name="index-g_t_002a-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-957"></a><br><dt><code>$*</code><dd>The stem with which an implicit rule matches (see <a href="Pattern-Match.html#Pattern-Match">How Patterns Match</a>).  If the target is <samp><span class="file">dir/a.foo.b</span></samp> and the target
pattern is <samp><span class="file">a.%.b</span></samp> then the stem is <samp><span class="file">dir/foo</span></samp>.  The stem is
useful for constructing names of related files. 
<a name="index-stem_002c-variable-for-958"></a>
In a static pattern rule, the stem is part of the file name that matched
the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; in the target pattern.

     <p>In an explicit rule, there is no stem; so &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$*</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot be determined
in that way.  Instead, if the target name ends with a recognized suffix
(see <a href="Suffix-Rules.html#Suffix-Rules">Old-Fashioned Suffix Rules</a>), &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$*</span></samp>&rsquo; is set to
the target name minus the suffix.  For example, if the target name is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo.c</span></samp>&rsquo;, then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$*</span></samp>&rsquo; is set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>&rsquo;, since &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.c</span></samp>&rsquo; is a
suffix.  GNU <code>make</code> does this bizarre thing only for compatibility
with other implementations of <code>make</code>.  You should generally avoid
using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$*</span></samp>&rsquo; except in implicit rules or static pattern rules.

     <p>If the target name in an explicit rule does not end with a recognized
suffix, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$*</span></samp>&rsquo; is set to the empty string for that rule. 
</dl>

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$?</span></samp>&rsquo; is useful even in explicit rules when you wish to operate on only
the prerequisites that have changed.  For example, suppose that an archive
named <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> is supposed to contain copies of several object files. 
This rule copies just the changed object files into the archive:

<pre class="example">     lib: foo.o bar.o lose.o win.o
             ar r lib $?
</pre>
   <p>Of the variables listed above, four have values that are single file
names, and three have values that are lists of file names.  These seven
have variants that get just the file's directory name or just the file
name within the directory.  The variant variables' names are formed by
appending &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">F</span></samp>&rsquo;, respectively.  These variants are
semi-obsolete in GNU <code>make</code> since the functions <code>dir</code> and
<code>notdir</code> can be used to get a similar effect (see <a href="File-Name-Functions.html#File-Name-Functions">Functions for File Names</a>).  Note, however, that the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">D</span></samp>&rsquo; variants all omit the trailing slash which always appears in
the output of the <code>dir</code> function.  Here is a table of the variants:

     
<a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_0040_0040D_0029-959"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040_0040D-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-960"></a>
<dl><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(@D)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The directory part of the file name of the target, with the trailing
slash removed.  If the value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo; is <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.o</span></samp> then
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(@D)</span></samp>&rsquo; is <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp>.  This value is <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> if &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo; does
not contain a slash.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_0040_0040F_0029-961"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040_0040F-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-962"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(@F)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The file-within-directory part of the file name of the target.  If the
value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$@</span></samp>&rsquo; is <samp><span class="file">dir/foo.o</span></samp> then &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(@F)</span></samp>&rsquo; is
<samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp>.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(@F)</span></samp>&rsquo; is equivalent to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(notdir $@)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_002aD_0029-963"></a><a name="index-g_t_002aD-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-964"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(*D)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_002aF_0029-965"></a><a name="index-g_t_002aF-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-966"></a><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(*F)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The directory part and the file-within-directory
part of the stem; <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> in this example.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_0025D_0029-967"></a><a name="index-g_t_0025D-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-968"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(%D)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_0025F_0029-969"></a><a name="index-g_t_0025F-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-970"></a><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(%F)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The directory part and the file-within-directory part of the target
archive member name.  This makes sense only for archive member targets
of the form <samp><var>archive</var><span class="file">(</span><var>member</var><span class="file">)</span></samp> and is useful only when
<var>member</var> may contain a directory name.  (See <a href="Archive-Members.html#Archive-Members">Archive Members as Targets</a>.)

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_003cD_0029-971"></a><a name="index-g_t_003cD-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-972"></a><br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(&lt;D)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd><a name="index-g_t_0024_0028_003cF_0029-973"></a><a name="index-g_t_003cF-_0040r_007b_0028automatic-variable_0029_007d-974"></a><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(&lt;F)</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The directory part and the file-within-directory

   <p>Note that we use a special stylistic convention when we talk about these
automatic variables; we write &ldquo;the value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;&rdquo;, rather than
&ldquo;the&nbsp;variable&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>&rdquo;<!-- /@w --> as we would write for ordinary variables
such as <code>objects</code> and <code>CFLAGS</code>.  We think this convention
looks more natural in this special case.  Please do not assume it has a
deep significance; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo; refers to the variable named <code>&lt;</code> just
as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(CFLAGS)</span></samp>&rsquo; refers to the variable named <code>CFLAGS</code>. 
You could just as well use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$(&lt;)</span></samp>&rsquo; in place of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$&lt;</span></samp>&rsquo;.
