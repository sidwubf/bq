automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 Pitfalls of Using Wildcards</h4>

<p><a name="index-wildcard-pitfalls-159"></a><a name="index-pitfalls-of-wildcards-160"></a><a name="index-mistakes-with-wildcards-161"></a><a name="index-errors-with-wildcards-162"></a><a name="index-problems-with-wildcards-163"></a>
Now here is an example of a naive way of using wildcard expansion, that
does not do what you would intend.  Suppose you would like to say that the
executable file <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> is made from all the object files in the
directory, and you write this:

<pre class="example">     objects = *.o
     
     foo : $(objects)
             cc -o foo $(CFLAGS) $(objects)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The value of <code>objects</code> is the actual string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*.o</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Wildcard
expansion happens in the rule for <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>, so that each <em>existing</em>
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; file becomes a prerequisite of <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> and will be recompiled if
necessary.

   <p>But what if you delete all the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>&rsquo; files?  When a wildcard matches
no files, it is left as it is, so then <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> will depend on the
oddly-named file <samp><span class="file">*.o</span></samp>.  Since no such file is likely to exist,
<code>make</code> will give you an error saying it cannot figure out how to
make <samp><span class="file">*.o</span></samp>.  This is not what you want!

   <p>Actually it is possible to obtain the desired result with wildcard
expansion, but you need more sophisticated techniques, including the
<code>wildcard</code> function and string substitution. 
See <a href="Wildcard-Function.html#Wildcard-Function">The Function <code>wildcard</code></a>.

Microsoft operating systems (MS-DOS and MS-Windows) use backslashes to
separate directories in pathnames, like so:

<pre class="example">       c:\foo\bar\baz.c
</pre>
   <p>This is equivalent to the Unix-style <samp><span class="file">c:/foo/bar/baz.c</span></samp> (the
<samp><span class="file">c:</span></samp> part is the so-called drive letter).  When <code>make</code> runs on
these systems, it supports backslashes as well as the Unix-style forward
slashes in pathnames.  However, this support does <em>not</em> include the
wildcard expansion, where backslash is a quote character.  Therefore,
you <em>must</em> use Unix-style slashes in these cases.
